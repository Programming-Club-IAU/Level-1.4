## comments

**For absence**
 If you have an excuse for absence, enter  "hospital‚Äù and a day of absence will be added to you.

**Subjects**
 Which is counted as absence
 (math, physics, chemistry, programming).

**minimum attendance day**
   - math classes should be attended 44 days out of 50
   - physics classes should be attended 42 days out of 50
   - chemistry classes should be attended 40 days out of 50
   - programming classes should be attended 47 days out of 50

**success**
 You must meet the following conditions:
      1- Do not be absent more than permitted
      2- Cumulative GPA above 3.5

## Some things we will use inside the code

**input/output**
 1- input :
  We use Scanner
  ( import java.util.Scanner; )
 2- output :
  System.out.print();

**If and for**
 We use the condition function `IF` to determine success and failure or whether there is an excuse or not

 We use the iteration function `For` to insert and output values from presence

**ASCII**
 I put the university abbreviation `IAU` to give it a better appearance
